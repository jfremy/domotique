The first, and obvious reason is that node.js is asynchronous, and therefore our tests need to be. The second reason is to make test suites which target I/O libraries run much faster.\n\n_Vows_ is an experiment in making this possible, while adding a minimum of overhead.\n\nsynopsis\n--------\n\n    var vows = require('vows'),\n        assert = require('assert');\n\n    vows.describe('Deep Thought').addBatch({\n        'An instance of DeepThought': {\n            topic: new DeepThought,\n\n            'should know the answer to the ultimate question of life': function (deepThought) {\n                assert.equal (deepThought.question('what is the answer to the universe?'), 42);\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\ninstallation\n------------\n\n    $ npm install vows\n\ndocumentation\n-------------\n\nHead over to <http://vowsjs.org>\n\n",
